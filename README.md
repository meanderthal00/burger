## About
Git-N-My Belly  is an application to help fill the endless void that is my stomach. With it you can create and devour delicious, delicious burgers. This is my attempt at a full-stack application. I have employed a mySQL database to store data, Node.js, Express server, JavaScript, and a Bootstrap front-end interface.
